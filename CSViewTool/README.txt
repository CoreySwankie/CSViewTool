To make sure the tool works you must add 2 layers to your project "Players" and "WorldObjects". Apply the "Players" layer to the player characters and the "WorldObjects" Layer to all collidable objects.

Alternatively, if your objects are already on layers like this you can change the layer names on the Tool User Settings located in the scritps folder. Currently thought there is only support for a Players Layer and a World Objects/Collidables layer. Extension to this is planned in the future.

To Access the tool window, go to the 'Tools > CS View Tool Manager', this should open the View Tool Manager window that you can then move around or dock as needed.

Finally, to run the tool, press play.
